# CONTACTS BOOK

Simplistic Android app allowing to store list of people as contacts, also including their location on the map.

## Features

### Cloud storage + Social login

You can create a personalized account using multiple providers (featured by Firebase): email address, Facebook, Google. This enables you to share your data between multiple devices and also minimizes risk accidentally of losing it.

### Local storage

In case you don't want to associate your contacts with a cloud account, the default setup is to store data locally in a Room database.

### Map pinpoint

When adding a contact, you can pick their location on the map for better illustration.

### Multilanguage

The app can be extended to contain additional languages (currently English and Macedonian).
